# BigramsCompleteMe

BigramsCompleteMe is a sublime text plugin that sorts autocompletion results by their probability given the previous word. The plugin is designed to be used for editing text files, the main feature being improved "insert_best_completion" accuracy. In many cases, you can repeat an existing phrase such as "sublime text" with just the first letters of each word (e.g. `s`, `space`, `tab`, `t`, `space`, `tab`).
